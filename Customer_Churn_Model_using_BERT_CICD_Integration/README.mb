## 1. Project Overview
•	Objective: To classify customer churn based on telephonic conversations using a BERT model, with deployment and CI/CD managed through Databricks and Azure DevOps.
•	Data: Telephonic conversation transcripts labeled as churned or not churned.

## 2. Data Collection and Preprocessing
•	Data Collection:
o	Gathered telephonic conversation transcripts from Bell Canada Telecom.
o	Assigned labels to the conversations indicating whether the customer churned or not.
•	Data Preprocessing:
o	Text Cleaning: Remove noise such as filler words, irrelevant text, and non-verbal cues.
o	Tokenization: Break down the text into tokens (words or subwords).
o	Padding/Truncation: Ensure all input sequences are of the same length for BERT processing.
o	Label Encoding: Convert the churn labels into numerical format (e.g., 0 for not churned, 1 for churned).

##3. Model Development

•	Model Selection:
o	Chose BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text classification due to its state-of-the-art performance on NLP tasks.
•	Model Training:
o	Fine-tuned the BERT model on your labeled dataset.
o	Utilized techniques like learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and regularization to optimize model performance.
•	Evaluation:
o	Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
o	Visualized performance through confusion matrices and classification reports.

                                                                  
## 4. MLflow Integration in Databricks
•	MLflow Tracking:
o	Integrated MLflow for tracking experiments, logging parameters, metrics, and model artifacts within Databricks.
o	Created versioned models for easy comparison and deployment.
•	MLflow Models:
o	Logged the trained BERT model as an MLflow model, allowing easy loading and inference.
•	Model Registry:
o	Registered the model in the MLflow Model Registry for version control and stage transitions (e.g., Staging, Production).
## 5. CI/CD Pipeline with Azure DevOps
•	Pipeline Setup:
o	Set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate model deployment.
•	Continuous Integration (CI):
o	Configured the pipeline to automatically trigger on code commits.
o	Included steps for code linting, unit tests, and integration tests to ensure code quality.
•	Continuous Deployment (CD):
o	Automated the deployment of the MLflow model from Databricks to a production environment.
o	Implemented staging environments to validate the model before full production deployment.
•	Testing:
o	Incorporated automated testing in the pipeline to validate the model’s predictions against a validation dataset.
o	Added post-deployment monitoring to track model performance in production.
                                                                  
                                                                  
##6. Model Deployment
•	Databricks Deployment:
o	Deployed the BERT model in a Databricks environment, using MLflow's model serving capabilities.
o	Configured Databricks to serve the model as a REST API, enabling integration with other systems (e.g., CRM tools).
•	Scalability:
o	Ensured the deployment could scale with increasing demand, utilizing Databricks’ scalable infrastructure.

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance
•	Monitoring:
o	Set up monitoring for the deployed model to track performance, accuracy, and resource usage.
o	Used tools like Azure Monitor and Databricks’ built-in monitoring features.
•	Model Retraining:
o	Established a feedback loop to collect new data for retraining the model periodically.
o	Automated retraining and redeployment through the CI/CD pipeline as new data becomes available.
## 8. Documentation and Reporting
•	Documentation:
o	Documented the entire process, from data preprocessing to model deployment and CI/CD setup.
o	Included API documentation for accessing the deployed model.
•	Reporting:
o	Generated reports on model performance, customer churn rates, and system usage.
o	Provided stakeholders with insights into the factors contributing to customer churn.
## 9. Future Enhancements
•	Model Improvement:
o	Consider exploring other NLP models like GPT or T5 to see if they improve classification performance.
o	Experiment with ensemble techniques or hybrid models combining BERT with traditional machine learning algorithms.
•	Feature Expansion:
o	Extend the project to include other data sources, such as customer demographics or service usage patterns, to improve model accuracy.
o	Implement real-time model updates based on incoming customer data.
This detailed process will guide you through building a robust churn classification system with automated deployment and monitoring, leveraging the power of Azure and Databricks.
