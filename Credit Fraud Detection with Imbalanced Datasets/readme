 Project Overview: Credit Fraud Detection with Imbalanced Datasets
Objective: The project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions within a heavily imbalanced dataset. It employs resampling techniques and machine learning models to improve the detection accuracy of fraudulent cases, addressing the imbalance challenge effectively.
Data:
- Description: A credit card transactions dataset with anonymized features, including transaction time and amount, where the majority of transactions are legitimate, and a small fraction are fraudulent.

# Key Project Components
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing:
   - Explored data distribution to identify skewed patterns.
   - Scaling and PCA Transformation: Prepared the features using scaling and PCA to handle dimensionality while preserving important patterns.

2. Resampling Techniques for Imbalance:
   - Random UnderSampling and SMOTE: Applied NearMiss (for undersampling) and SMOTE (for oversampling) techniques to create a more balanced dataset.
   - Implemented anomaly detection methods to aid in identifying fraudulent transactions.

3. Modeling:
   - Trained various classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, evaluating each for their effectiveness in handling imbalanced data.
   - Tuned models with hyperparameter optimization, using class weighting and cross-validation.

4. Evaluation Metrics:
   - Focused on suitable metrics like F1-Score, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix to accurately measure performance, avoiding misleading accuracy metrics.
