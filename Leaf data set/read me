# Project Overview: Leaf Disease Classification (Computer Vision)

This project focuses on identifying and classifying diseases in plant leaves using computer vision techniques. It leverages deep learning models to process leaf images and predict potential diseases, offering valuable insights for agriculture.

### Project Breakdown:
- **Modeling**: Developed a leaf disease classification model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Applied various preprocessing techniques like **image augmentation** (rotation, flipping, scaling) to improve model accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

### Key Features:
1. **Disease Classification**: The model classifies plant leaf images into different disease categories, aiding in plant health monitoring.
2. **Image Augmentation**: Preprocessing techniques such as random rotations, flips, and zooms to enhance the modelâ€™s robustness.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's effectiveness in disease detection.

### Tech Stack:
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

### Setup Instructions:
1. **Dataset**: Download the dataset with labeled leaf images. Ensure the images are organized in separate folders for each disease category.
2. **Model**:
   - The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras. To train the model:
     ```python
     import tensorflow as tf
     model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])  # Define your CNN layers
     model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=10)
     ```
3. **Image Augmentation**:
   - For image preprocessing, augmentation techniques are applied during model training:
     ```python
     from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
     datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=40, width_shift_range=0.2, height_shift_range=0.2)
     ```
4. **Evaluation**:
   - After training the model, evaluate its performance:
     ```python
     test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_data)
     print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc}")
     ```

### How It Works:
1. **Input**: Users provide images of plant leaves for disease classification.
2. **Prediction**: The CNN model predicts the type of disease or confirms if the leaf is healthy.
3. **Visualization**: The model outputs the classification result and visualizes it using matplotlib.

### Usage Scenarios:
- **Agricultural researchers** can use this project to automate the process of detecting plant diseases.
- **Farmers** can monitor plant health and take preventive measures based on early disease detection.
- **Agricultural apps** can integrate this model to provide disease identification services to users.
